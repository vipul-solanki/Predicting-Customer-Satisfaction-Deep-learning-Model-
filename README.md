This project tackles a common problem for e-commerce platforms: **How can we know if a customer is unhappy *before* they leave a bad review?** Instead of relying on slow, reactive surveys, this project builds a deep learning model to predict a customer's satisfaction score in real-time, based on the data from their support interaction.

The goal is to turn customer service from a reactive "damage control" unit into a proactive "customer happiness" engine.

## Key Features ‚ú®
* **Deep Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** A full investigation into the data with over 10+ visualizations to uncover hidden patterns and tell a story.
* **Multi-Input Neural Network:** A special two-branch neural network designed to simultaneously understand different types of data:
    * An **LSTM branch** to analyze the sentiment and context of customer's text comments.
    * A **Dense branch** to learn from tabular data like issue category, agent tenure, and item price.
* **Optimized Training:** Implemented **Early Stopping** to train the model efficiently, prevent overfitting, and automatically find the best version of the model.
* **Model Interpretability with SHAP:** Used advanced SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) techniques to look inside the "black box" model and understand exactly *why* it makes its predictions.

## The Core Insight üéØ
After building and analyzing the model, one finding stood out above all others:

> **Response Time is the most critical factor influencing customer satisfaction.**

Our final SHAP analysis proved that `response_time_minutes` was overwhelmingly the most important feature the model used to predict a customer's CSAT score. This provides a clear, actionable insight for the business: the fastest way to improve satisfaction is to improve response speed.

---
## Model Performance üìä
The final, optimized model achieved a **Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.84** on the unseen test set.

This means, on average, the model's prediction of a customer's 1-5 satisfaction score is off by only **0.84 points**, providing a solid and reliable predictive signal.
